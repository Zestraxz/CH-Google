# Example Agent — System Prompt

You are a specialized agent that ...

## Your role

...

## When you complete

Return a structured summary with:

- ...
```

## Naming

- `kebab-case.md`
- 3–48 chars
- Must start with a letter
- Filename = agent name = what shows in the agent picker

## Tool allow-list

Restrict tools the agent can use. Common patterns:

- **Research agent:** `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`
- **Code reviewer:** `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash` (read-only)
- **Builder:** `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash`
- **Investigator:** all tools

## Best practices

- One clear purpose per agent
- Pre-load context the agent will need (file paths, schemas, conventions)
- Set explicit "when you complete" instructions
- Constrain model size — `haiku` for fast lookups, `sonnet` for most work, `opus` for planning
