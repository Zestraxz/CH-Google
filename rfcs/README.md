## When to write an RFC vs an ADR

|           | RFC                                                | ADR                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Purpose   | Discussion (multiple options, debate)              | Record (one decided outcome)         |
| Lifecycle | Active -> Accepted/Rejected/Withdrawn              | Proposed -> Accepted -> (Superseded) |
| Location  | `rfcs/active/`, `rfcs/accepted/`, `rfcs/rejected/` | `docs/04-quality/adr/NNNN-title.md`  |
| Numbering | Incrementing within `rfcs/`                        | Strict sequential numbering          |

## Flow

1. Copy `0000-template.md` to `active/NNNN-short-title.md`.
2. Open PR. Discuss in PR comments.
3. After consensus:
   - **Accepted:** move to `accepted/`. Create an ADR capturing the decision.
   - **Rejected:** move to `rejected/` with a one-line summary at the top explaining why.
   - **Withdrawn:** move to `rejected/` (or delete).

## Inspiration

Rust, Ember, React, Stripe, Glovo, LinkedIn all use this pattern.
