### I-001 — Example: Mocked tests passed but prod migration failed

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Phase:** 2
**Severity:** High
**Status:** Resolved (commit `<sha>`)

**Symptom:**
Integration tests for migration `0042_add_user_status` green in CI; deploy to staging dropped a column.

**Root cause:**
Tests used SQLite mock; prod is Postgres. SQLite silently accepted `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN`; Postgres requires `CASCADE` and the migration didn't include it.

**Fix:**
Added `CASCADE` to the migration. Switched integration test DB to a real Postgres container via testcontainers.

**Prevention:**

- ADR-0007: "Integration tests run against real Postgres, not SQLite mocks."
- CI now spins up postgres:16-alpine for `pnpm test:integration`.
