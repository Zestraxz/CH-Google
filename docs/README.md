## Adding a new doc

1. Pick the right folder (or create a numbered sibling if the topic doesn't fit).
2. Use `kebab-case-name.md` (lowercase).
3. Add a one-line entry to the parent folder's README (if one exists).
4. Cross-link from any related doc.

## When a doc goes stale

Don't delete it — move it to [99-archive/](99-archive/) with a note explaining why.
