## Decision thresholds

| Decision type                                                 | Required approvals                          | SLA              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Trivial (typos, formatting, docs only)                        | 1 maintainer                                | 1 business day   |
| Routine (feature, fix, refactor within existing architecture) | 1 maintainer                                | 5 business days  |
| Schema / contract change (breaks consumers)                   | 1 maintainer + 1 reviewer                   | 7 business days  |
| Architecture change (new stack, new service, pattern shift)   | Maintainer + ADR with majority of reviewers | 14 business days |
| Governance change (this file, CODEOWNERS, CLAUDE.md)          | Maintainer                                  | 14 business days |

## ADR process

For any decision that:

- Changes the stack
- Adds a load-bearing dependency
- Changes a public contract (API, schema, event shape)
- Establishes a convention people must follow
- Reverses a prior decision

Open an ADR. Template: [../04-quality/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md](../04-quality/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md).

Process:

1. Copy template → new number.
2. Open PR with ADR + (optionally) supporting code.
3. Discuss in PR comments.
4. Maintainer marks `Status: Accepted` or `Status: Rejected`.
5. If Accepted, the ADR is binding until superseded by a later ADR.

## Conflict resolution

1. Try to resolve in PR comments / channel discussion.
2. If stuck for > 3 business days, escalate to maintainer.
3. Maintainer's decision is final but must be recorded as an ADR with rationale.

## Decision log

All accepted ADRs live in [../04-quality/adr/](../04-quality/adr/). Read them before proposing changes in adjacent areas.
