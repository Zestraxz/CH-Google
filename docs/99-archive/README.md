## When to archive a doc

A doc moves here when:

- The feature/practice it describes is no longer in use
- It's been superseded by a newer doc (link from the new one back to the old)
- It contained guidance that turned out to be wrong (archive with a top-of-file note explaining why)

## How to archive

```bash
git mv docs/<section>/<old-doc>.md docs/99-archive/<old-doc>.md
```

Add a note at the top of the archived file:

```markdown
> **ARCHIVED YYYY-MM-DD.**
> Reason: <one line>
> Superseded by: <link if applicable>
```

## What's here

| Doc          | Archived | Reason |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ |
| _(none yet)_ |          |        |
