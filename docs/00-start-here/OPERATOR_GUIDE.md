## What this system does

TODO: paragraph describing Google

## Daily operation

| What                | Command                                                   | When                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Bring everything up | `.\START_HERE.cmd` (Windows) / `./01_setup/run.sh` (Unix) | Each morning / after reboot        |
| Open docs + URLs    | `.\OPEN_ARTIFACTS.cmd`                                    | When you need to look something up |
| Check health        | `.\scripts\02-verify\verify-local.ps1`                    | Periodically; before deploying     |
| Stop everything     | `docker compose down`                                     | End of day                         |

## Key URLs (when running locally)

| Service  | URL                        | Healthy looks like                  |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000      | App home page renders               |
| API      | http://localhost:8000      | JSON `{"status":"ok"}` at `/health` |
| API docs | http://localhost:8000/docs | OpenAPI/Swagger UI                  |

## Periodic tasks

| Task                      | Frequency  | Command                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Pull latest               | Daily      | `git pull --rebase`                 |
| Update deps               | Weekly     | review Renovate / Dependabot PRs    |
| Backup DB (prod only)     | Daily auto | see `04_tools/backup/`              |
| Restore drill (prod only) | Quarterly  | see `docs/03-deployment/RUNBOOK.md` |
| Rotate secrets            | Quarterly  | see `.env.example` + secret manager |

## Common operator scenarios

### "Service won't start"

1. `.\scripts\02-verify\verify-local.ps1` — check what's failing
2. `docker compose logs --tail=200 <service>` — read recent errors
3. `docker compose restart <service>` — try a restart
4. If still broken: see `docs/03-deployment/RUNBOOK.md` per-service playbooks

### "I need to deploy"

1. Read `docs/03-deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md` first
2. Confirm CI is green on the commit you want to ship
3. Tag the release: `git tag v0.X.Y && git push --tags`
4. CI handles the rest (see deploy workflow)

### "I need to add an env var"

1. Add it to `.env.example` first (variable name + placeholder value)
2. Add validation to env schema (`packages/shared/src/env.ts` or `src/<pkg>/config.py`)
3. Update production secret manager
4. Document in this file under "Required env vars"

### "I broke something and want to roll back"

1. `git log --oneline -10` — find the last good commit
2. For code: revert the bad commit. Don't reset main.
3. For prod: re-deploy the previous tag — see RUNBOOK.

## Required env vars (production)

The system refuses to boot without these (env validation fails fast).

| Var              | What it's for       | Where to set in prod              |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`   | Postgres connection | Secret manager                    |
| `REDIS_URL`      | Cache + queue       | Secret manager                    |
| `JWT_SECRET`     | Auth                | Secret manager (rotate quarterly) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Sessions            | Secret manager (rotate quarterly) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`   | Allowed origins     | Env var, no comma in domain       |

For the full list, see `.env.example`.

## Escalation

- Service down: see `docs/03-deployment/RUNBOOK.md`
- Security incident: see `docs/02-governance/SECURITY.md`
- Data subject request (GDPR): see `docs/02-governance/PRIVACY.md`
- Unknown / panic: contact the maintainer (see `CODEOWNERS`)

## DO NOT

- Run destructive ops (DROP, DELETE without WHERE, `git push --force` to `main`) without confirmation
- Push commits without running `pnpm precommit` first (or equivalent)
- Disable env validation to "make it boot" — the env is wrong; fix it
- Commit secrets, `.env`, or generated files
