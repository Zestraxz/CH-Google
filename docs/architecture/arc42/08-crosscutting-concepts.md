| Concept            | Implementation                                                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logging            | Structured JSON via pino (TS) / structlog (Py); correlation ID per request |
| Metrics            | OpenTelemetry; RED method for services, USE for resources                  |
| Tracing            | OpenTelemetry; auto-instrumented HTTP/DB/queue                             |
| Error tracking     | Sentry; sourcemaps uploaded in CI                                          |
| Authn              | JWT short-lived + refresh token (httpOnly cookie)                          |
| Authz              | Middleware per route; deny by default                                      |
| Validation         | Zod (TS) / Pydantic (Py) at every boundary                                 |
| Errors             | Typed `AppError` hierarchy; HTTP status mapped at boundary                 |
| Config             | Zod/Pydantic env validation at boot (fails build on bad env)               |
| AI cost guardrails | `LLM_DAILY_BUDGET_USD` env cap; 429 on exceed                              |
