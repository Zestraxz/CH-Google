# START HERE → Google

> Cold-reader onboarding. If you're new here (human, AI, or future-you), start at the top.

## 1. What this is

TODO: paragraph describing Google

**Current state:** see [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

## 2. Run it in 30 seconds

**Windows:**

```cmd
.\START_HERE.cmd
```

**Bash:**

```bash
./01_setup/run.sh
```

The bootstrap script will:

1. Check prerequisites (Node, Python, Docker as applicable).
2. Create `.env` from `.env.example` if it doesn't exist.
3. Install dependencies.
4. Bring up Docker services.
5. Wait for healthchecks.
6. Open the app in your browser.

## 6. Common operations

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Format + lint + typecheck
pnpm precommit

# Reset local DB
.\scripts\03-database\reset.ps1

# Push a commit safely
.\04_tools\GitPush.ps1 -Message "feat: ..."
```

## 7. When you're lost

- **Where do I put X?** Check [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md).
- **Why is X built this way?** Check [docs/04-quality/adr/](docs/04-quality/adr/) for the ADR.
- **What was tried before that didn't work?** Check [02_active/ISSUES_AND_LEARNINGS.md](02_active/ISSUES_AND_LEARNINGS.md).
- **Service won't start?** Check [docs/03-deployment/RUNBOOK.md](docs/03-deployment/RUNBOOK.md).

## 8. When something is genuinely new

Open an ADR: copy [docs/04-quality/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md](docs/04-quality/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md), increment the number, fill in the decision.
