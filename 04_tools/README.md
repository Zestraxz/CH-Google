## When to add here

A script earns its place in `04_tools/` when:

1. It's been used successfully in production (not just dev)
2. It handles failure gracefully (idempotent, errors loud, exit codes meaningful)
3. It has either a README section or inline docstring explaining usage + caveats
4. It's owned (CODEOWNERS points to a maintainer)

Until then, keep it in `scripts/` (lifecycle scripts) or `01_setup/` (bootstrap).

## When NOT to refactor

- Don't "modernize" `GitPush.ps1` without a real bug — it works
- Don't change SQL initialization scripts without a migration story
- Don't change infra without testing on a throwaway environment
